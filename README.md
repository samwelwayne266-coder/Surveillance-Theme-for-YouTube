## ⚡ Overview
**WAYNE_CORE** is a comprehensive UI hijacking suite for YouTube. It strips away the standard consumer interface and replaces it with a high-contrast, tactical surveillance terminal. Designed for minimalist data extraction and high-tech immersion.

---

## 🛠️ System Protocols
* **Surveillance HUD:** Direct injection of `● REC` indicators, tactical corner brackets, and live timestamps into the video player.
* **Ghost Search:** Total suppression of the YouTube homepage. Only a centered, terminal-style search bar remains.
* **EndOfStream (EOS):** Automatic trigger of `[LOW_BATTERY]` warnings and procedural signal jitter/interference when a video reaches its final 6 seconds.
* **Breach Command:** Integrated secret-key override. Type `WAYNE` anywhere to initiate a system-wide visual inversion.
* **Audio Synthesis:** Procedural square-wave feedback for every interaction, simulating a 1980s mainframe.
